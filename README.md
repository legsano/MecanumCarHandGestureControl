# ESP32Project
Contributors: Desi Fitriana, Dio Dwika Pramana, Dafa Rabbani

This is a project to create a program for a mecanum car which is controlled using hand gestures using ESP32 as a microcontroller and using MPU6050 as a gyro and accelerometer sensor. 
Then we use the DMP method as a filter so that the pitch and roll output is more stable.

I programmed it using Arduino IDE software..
